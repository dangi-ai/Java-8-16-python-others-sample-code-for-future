# Summary

Interview techniques for problem solving in coding and system design interviews involve reframing the purpose of the interview, embracing failure, working backwards from the ideal solution, focusing on critical aspects, seeking constraints, and exploring hypothetical scenarios.

## Highlights
- **00:32** ⭐ Reframe the purpose of the interview as assessing problem-solving skills rather than providing the correct solution.
- **02:28** ⭐ Embrace failure and demonstrate self-awareness and regression to showcase problem-solving abilities.
- **06:24** ⭐ Work backwards from the ideal solution to identify necessary steps and demonstrate strategic thinking.
- **09:47** ⭐ Focus on critical aspects using the 80/20 rule to prioritize efforts and display clear thinking.
- **12:50** ⭐ Seek constraints and non-functional requirements to clarify decision-making and avoid analysis paralysis.
- **15:48** ⭐ Explore hypothetical scenarios to anticipate issues, showcase critical thinking, and build rapport with the interviewer.

## Key Insights
- ⭐ Embracing failure in interviews can be an opportunity to demonstrate problem-solving abilities and self-awareness. It shows the ability to acknowledge and regress from mistakes, which is crucial in real-world problem-solving.
- ⭐ Working backwards from the ideal solution helps to identify the necessary steps and guides decision-making in problem-solving. It showcases strategic thinking and clarity in problem-solving approaches.
- ⭐ Focusing on critical aspects using the 80/20 rule allows for efficient problem-solving in interviews. It demonstrates clear thinking and prioritization skills, which are essential for successful software engineering or system design.
- ⭐ Seeking constraints and non-functional requirements in interviews helps to avoid analysis paralysis and focus on the most important aspects of the problem. It allows for creative problem-solving within a limited scope.
- ⭐ Exploring hypothetical scenarios in interviews showcases the ability to anticipate issues and think critically. It helps build rapport with the interviewer and demonstrates a thorough understanding of the problem domain.
- ⭐ These interview techniques are not meant to replace problem-solving skills but rather enhance them. They provide additional tools to showcase problem-solving abilities in a more effective and impressive way.
