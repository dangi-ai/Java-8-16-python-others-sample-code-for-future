# Top 10 Features/Skills Every Spring Boot Java Developer Should Know as a Team Lead

## **1. Core Spring Boot Fundamentals**
- **Dependency Injection (DI)**: Understand and efficiently use Spring's core feature for managing beans and dependencies.
- **Spring Boot Auto-Configuration**: Leverage auto-configuration to simplify application setup.
- **Profiles and Configuration**: Master environment-specific configurations using profiles (`application-{profile}.properties`) and externalized configuration.

## **2. Advanced Spring Boot Configuration**
- **Custom Starters**: Create custom Spring Boot starters for reusable components across multiple projects.
- **Health Checks and Monitoring**: Use **Spring Boot Actuator** to monitor application health, expose custom metrics, and build observability into microservices.

## **3. REST API Development**
- **Spring MVC**: Deep knowledge of controllers, request mappings, and response entities.
- **Validation**: Implement robust input validation with `@Valid` and custom validators.
- **HATEOAS**: Understand how to make APIs self-descriptive and navigable.

## **4. Microservices Architecture**
- **Spring Cloud**: Familiarity with Spring Cloud components for building resilient and scalable microservices (e.g., Eureka, Config Server, Zuul/Gateway, and Hystrix).
- **Service Communication**: Proficiency in using **Feign Clients** and **RestTemplate** for inter-service communication.

## **5. Database and ORM Mastery**
- **Spring Data JPA**: Expertise in repository patterns, custom queries, and advanced JPA features like caching, lazy/eager loading.
